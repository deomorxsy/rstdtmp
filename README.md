# Teixo
Personal website template with blog and other sections in Rust to learn webdev concepts. Spiritual child of my [previous experiences](https://github.com/deomorxsy/deomorxsy.github.io/) with Static Site Generators such as Jekyll and Hugo, also sligthly based on the infrastructure design by security-union's [yew-actix template](https://github.com/security-union/yew-actix-template/).

Featuring
- Actix as front-end
- Yew as back-end
- WASM/WebAssembly as virtualization API madness
